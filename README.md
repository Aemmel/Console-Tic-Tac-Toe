Console-Tic-Tac-Toe
===================

This is my first Tic-Tac-Toe ever programmed and my second game I've programmed so far. (You can find my first on my Profile as well). 

I used a numeration for the field which I DON'T  recommend. I used this numeration: 0  1  2
                                                                                    3  4  5
                                                                                    6  7  8
                                                                                    
I'd rather recommend a Coordinate system, like this: 0 1 2 3 (X-axis)
                                                     1
                                                     2
                                                     3 (Y-axis)
Because, it'd be easier (or possible) to programm a good algorithm for it, with less then 300 lines of Code (or more).
